COORDINATE FLIP FEATURE - FIX SUMMARY
========================================

PROBLEM:
When you flip board coordinates in Board Editor, the setting was lost when switching to Analysis Mode.

ROOT CAUSE:
The coordinatesFlipped state never left the BoardEditor component - it wasn't passed through the callback to parent components.

SOLUTION:
Created a data pipeline to preserve the state across the component hierarchy:

  BoardEditor.jsx
  ├─ Added coordinatesFlipped state
  └─ Pass it in onDone callback ✓

  App.jsx  
  ├─ Added boardCoordinatesFlipped state
  ├─ Capture it in handleBoardDone()
  └─ Pass to GamePlay component ✓

  GamePlay.jsx
  ├─ Accept boardCoordinatesFlipped prop
  └─ Initialize boardFlipped with it ✓

COMPONENT CHAIN:
  BoardEditor(coordinatesFlipped) 
    ↓ onDone callback
  App(boardCoordinatesFlipped state)
    ↓ prop passed
  GamePlay(receives as prop)
    ↓ initializes boardFlipped
  ChessBoard(flipped prop)
    ↓ rendered
  Square components(display coordinates)

USER EXPERIENCE:
1. User flips coordinates in Board Editor: "↔️ Coords" button
2. User enters Analysis Mode: "▶️ Play" button
3. Coordinates remain flipped in Analysis Mode ✓
4. User can still toggle board flip: handleFlipBoard() ✓

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Default: boardCoordinatesFlipped = false (backward compatible)
- The ChessBoard and Square components already supported flipped display
- We just needed to preserve the state through the component tree
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

FILES MODIFIED:
✓ scan-web/src/BoardEditor.jsx (2 lines added to callbacks, button logic)
✓ scan-web/src/App.jsx (state + capture logic)
✓ scan-web/src/components/pages/GamePlay.jsx (prop + initialization)

TESTING:
1. Edit position in Board Editor
2. Click "↔️ Coords" to flip coordinates
3. Click "▶️ Play" to enter Analysis Mode
4. Verify coordinates are still flipped
5. Optional: Toggle flip board button to verify board rotation works independently

STATUS: ✓ COMPLETE
